### PyFlex Documentation (AI-Generated)

#### Introduction
PyFlex is a customizable Python shell environment designed to run and manage Python commands, system operations, and user-defined functions efficiently. This script facilitates command execution, custom command creation, and provides utility functions to manage the execution environment.

#### Version Information
- **PyFlex Version:** 1.1.1dev
- **Build ID:** 20240614223100L
- **Platform:** Determined by the user's operating system.
- **Python Version:** The current Python version and build being used.

#### Key Features
- **System Commands:** Execute system-level commands directly from the Python environment.
- **Custom Commands:** Define and manage custom commands with ease.
- **Multi-line Mode:** Support for multi-line command input, useful for writing longer scripts.
- **History Management:** Tracks command history and allows re-execution of past commands.
- **Environment Customization:** Clear the screen, manage Python packages, and navigate directories.

#### Core Functions

1. **cmd(\*args, \*\*kwargs):**
   - Executes system commands using the `os.system()` function.
   - Example: `cmd('ls' if __platform__ != 'Windows' else 'dir')`

2. **move_to_folder(folder):**
   - Changes the current working directory.
   - Example: `move_to_folder('/path/to/folder')`

3. **run(file_path):**
   - Executes a Python script located at `file_path`.
   - Example: `run('script.py')`

4. **install(lib):**
   - Installs a Python package using `pip`.
   - Example: `install('requests')`

5. **uninstall(lib):**
   - Uninstalls a Python package using `pip`.
   - Example: `uninstall('requests')`

6. **upgrade(lib):**
   - Upgrades an installed Python package.
   - Example: `upgrade('requests')`

7. **cls():**
   - Clears the console screen.
   - Example: `cls()`

8. **logs():**
   - Returns the command history as a formatted string.
   - Example: `print(logs())`

9. **exit():**
   - Exits the PyFlex environment.

10. **log(index=-1):**
    - Re-executes a command from history based on the provided `index`.
    - Example: `log(2)`

11. **__multi_line__(end_signal="main.run()", export_to_file=False):**
    - Enters multi-line input mode. Code execution ends when `end_signal` is detected.
    - Example: `__multi_line__()`

12. **__run__(inp, add_to_history=True, display=True):**
    - Executes a Python expression or statement within the environment, optionally logging it to history.

13. **create_customized_command(end_signal="main.run()"):**
    - Facilitates the creation of custom commands with optional arguments.
    - Example: `create_customized_command()`

14. **__del__(command):**
    - Deletes a specified command from the environment.
    - Example: `__del__('my_command')`

15. **__restore_default_elements__():**
    - Restores the environment to its default state by reloading the original build file.

16. **__active__(startup_command=False, auto_tab=True):**
    - Activates the PyFlex environment, initializing it for command input.
    - Example: `__active__()`

17. **__help__():**
    - Displays a help message summarizing available commands and their usage.

#### Usage Examples

- **Running a System Command:**  
  To list files in the current directory:
  ```python
  cmd('ls' if __platform__ != 'Windows' else 'dir')
  ```

- **Running a Python Script:**  
  To run a script located at `path/to/script.py`:
  ```python
  run('path/to/script.py')
  ```

- **Installing a Package:**  
  To install the `requests` library:
  ```python
  install('requests')
  ```

- **Clearing the Console:**  
  To clear the console screen:
  ```python
  cls()
  ```

- **Viewing Command History:**  
  To view the command history:
  ```python
  print(logs())
  ```

- **Exiting PyFlex:**  
  To exit the PyFlex environment:
  ```python
  exit()
  ```

- **Re-running a Command from History:**  
  To re-run the third command from history:
  ```python
  log(2)
  ```

- **Creating a Custom Command:**  
  To create a custom command:
  ```python
  create_customized_command()
  ```

- **Entering Multi-line Mode:**  
  To enter multi-line mode:
  ```python
  __multi_line__()
  ```

- **Deleting a Custom Command:**  
  To delete a command named `my_command`:
  ```python
  __del__('my_command')
  ```

- **Restoring Default Elements:**  
  To restore PyFlex to its default state:
  ```python
  __restore_default_elements__()
  ```

#### Conclusion
PyFlex provides a flexible, user-friendly interface for Python and system command execution. By offering custom command creation, history management, and various utility functions, PyFlex can be tailored to fit a wide range of scripting and automation needs.
